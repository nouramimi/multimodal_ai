<!--
If possible, please prioritize using discussions (https://github.com/Zulko/moviepy/discussions) or online forums for asking questions on how to use MoviePy, issues should be used mainly for questions about a specific behavior that seem incoherent and could possibly be a bug.
 
--------------------

You can format code by putting ``` (that's 3 backticks) on a line by itself at the beginning and end of each code block. For example:

```
from moviepy import *
clip = ColorClip((600, 400), color=(255, 100, 0), duration=2)
```
